 <h2>My Favorite Bollywood Movies</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>3 Idiots</h3>
 <p>This is my favorite movie because it has all the necessary elements in it such as drama, commedy, action, and more</p>
 <h3>PK</h3>
 <p>This movie brings/highlights the confusion created in a new person/creature by different religious traditions. <br />It also shows how a new being would look at the culture on the Earth.<br /> Good thing about this movie is that it completely exposes so called 'wrong numbers' by showing how they manipulate people and their mind.</p>
 <h3>Bhul Bhulaiya</h3>
 <p>This movie is the mix of both comedy and horror.</p>
